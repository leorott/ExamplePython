# Exercise
To practise the topics from the presentation you have now the time to create your own little python project. <br/>
Please create a little grade calculator. This calculator should have a variable with the maximum points. <br/>
Also implement two methods <br/>
- One function should output the possible grades (1, 2, 3...) using the range function
- The other function (signature: calculate_grade(points)) should calculate (points / max_points * 5 + 1) the grade and print it with a little comment relating to the grade. Of course, the user isn't allowed to set the points above the max points
