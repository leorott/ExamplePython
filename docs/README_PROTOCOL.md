We worked together for most of the Project, but did assign different tasks to each group member from time to time. This allowed us to communicate properly during the entire project whilst also being able to work on things individually. Communication is key, as to not drift off the road we are set to go on. We helped each other with rapid feedback when it comes to the individual work, which allowed us to stay on course.
