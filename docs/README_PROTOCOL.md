Most of the time we've been working together. To be more precise, one of us wrote the code or styled the PowerPoint and 
the others gave instant feedback, disguised what should be displayed on the slide and done some research on different topics. 
Mostly Leo has written the text or styled the slides and Luca and Ian helped him with ideas, suggestions or facts from their research.
